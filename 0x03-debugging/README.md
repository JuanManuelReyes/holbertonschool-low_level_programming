# 0x03. C - Debugging
### Concepts

_For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:_

-   [The Framework](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/75)

## Resources

**Read or watch:**

-   [Debugging](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/iADtJa-KkjYI56m-cQyWIw "Debugging")
-   [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sS_CVV32moC3tyEImNCvig "Rubber Duck Debugging")

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as  `gdb`  or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/mrElWdkThHc-wwWBat00qg "explain to anyone"), without the help of Google:

### General

-   What is debugging
-   What are some methods of debugging manually
-   How to read the error messages

## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using  `gcc`, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   Your code should use the  `Betty`  style. It will be checked using  `betty-style.pl`  and  `betty-doc.pl`
-   A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e.  `0x03-debugging`), describing what this project is about
